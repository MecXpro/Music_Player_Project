# Music_Player_Project
Audio is an important source of communication and is just as important today as text. We know that audio files are digital files. So, you need a tool to run the digital files, or in other words to play the files. We need an application that will allow us to play or listen to digital audio files. The music player is the device for playing MP3 files. The music GUI program application attempts to emulate the physical music player. This program allows you to play songs and music on your desktop or laptop. The main goal of this project is to enable users to play music and digital audio files. In order to be attractive to users, the application must have a simple but beautiful user interface. Music Player has options to play, pause and stop. We can have an interface to list the music files available.

Problem Definition:
Nowadays, many music supporting tools show adverts before listening to music or even in between the music. So, the user have to wait for the advertisement to end then resume their music or else they have to take the subscription of the tool to avoid ads as well as to download music.
